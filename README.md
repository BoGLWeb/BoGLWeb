# Welcome to BoGL Web

This is an MQP being completed at WPI with the goal of creating an application to aid students taking ME 4322.

BoGLWeb is create using Microsoft's Blazor WebAssembly.

The website can be accessed at: https://boglweb.github.io

## Local Development

If you want to build BoGL Web locally, it is easiest to use Visual Studio, although we were also able to use Rider with some extra setup. To open the project in Visual Studio:
1. Copy the URL https://github.com/BoGLWeb/BoGLWeb.github.io.git
2. Open Visual Studio, go to the File menu, and select Clone Repository...
3. Enter the above URL in the Repository location input and click Clone
4. Under the menu that says "Open a solution, folder, or other item", select BoGLWeb.sln
5. You should now be able to see all of the project files and build the website locally by clicking the green arrow in the middle of the upper menu strip
